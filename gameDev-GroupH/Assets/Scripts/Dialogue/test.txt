Nadiya_Ah, how did I land in this shithole? Full of cargo containers and shipping crates, and its all ancient.
Nadiya_Its a shame that the corps don't even wanna clean up this mess, this place could make a good few buildings. Hmm, even a base of operations for us.
Dreyar_Well, weve all landed in this area somehow, usually either the corpos or any gangs use this place to dump bodies, but somehow we've all survived.
Astra_Yeah... well, we at Bepis use this place for the dark operations, nobody enters here. Im sure we all have ended up here for some reason.
Joe_Wait.. How do you know this and why would you tell us this?
Astra_Bepis is the reason im here, and thats all your gonna get.
