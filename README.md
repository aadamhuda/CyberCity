### Known Issues:
The player may respawn at spawn sometimes after battle [Issue #105](https://github.com/aadamhuda/CyberCity/issues/105)
  - A bug has been found where when the player object exits the battle after a win, the player sometimes does not spawn back in the location it engaged the enemy, but rather spawns at the spawn point.
  - The trigger is currently unknown and needs to be investigated into.
